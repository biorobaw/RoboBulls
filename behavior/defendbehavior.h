 * @details DefendBehavior sets robots to sit at points around the goal, and get in the
 * line of motion of the ball and kick it back if it is coming torwards the goal. In addition,
 * if the ball is stopped on our side a robot will break to kick it, and also
 * the robots sway formation to face the ball if it on our side.
 * This also serves as a first iteration of an "intelligent agents" type of behavior,
 * where each robot independently runs the same behavior to without the need for a
 * strategy. This is made up of `DefendStates` which link to one another. */

/*! @file
 * AttackSupport tries to help score a goal by positioning a robot in an opportune position.
 *
 * A robot assigned this behavior will try to move to a position that satisfies the following criteria:
 * - There are no obstacles between the position and the goal.
 * - There are no obstacles between the position and the ball.
 * - The position is far enough from a ball possessor to make the pass viable.
 * - The position is not between the ball and the goal, to avoid blocking shots on goal.
 *
 * A position satisfying all four criteria is found by casting "shadows" on a probability field,
 * as described (in more detail) in AttackMain. @see AttackMain()
 *
 * The points in the probability field (discrete represenation of actual field)
 * are assigned values as follows:
 * - Decreasing probabilities as the points get farther from the goal post.
 * - Decreasing probabilities as the points get farther from the centerline stretching from one goal post to the other.
 * - Zero probability in the triangle between the ball point and the goal post (plus some tolerance).
 * - Zero probability in a circle around the ball, to avoid passes that are too short.

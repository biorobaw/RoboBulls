/*! @file
 * AttackMain tries to emulate the behavior of a striker/forward attacker in real soccer.
 *
 * A robot assigned this behavior will prioritize the following objectives:
 * - Kicking to the goal if a clear shot is available.
 * - Passing to a teammate if a clear pass is available.
 * - Dribbling the ball to a position where 1) or 2) is possible.
 *
 * Objectives 1) and 2) are straight-forward in terms of implementation.
 * We simply check if the path between the ball and the opponent goal post is
 * sufficiently clear of obstacles.
 *
 * Objective 3) requires the calculation of a point in the field from which
 * it is possible to score. This calculation is faciliated by a
 * probability field which stores the probability of scoring from a each point
 * in a sparse discrete representation of the field. A sparse represenation is
 * used, as opposed to processing every point possible within the field boundaries,
 * for performance reasons.
 *
 * The points in the probability field (discrete represenation of actual field)
 * are assigned values as follows:
 * - Decreasing probabilities as the points get farther from the goal post
 * - Decreasing probabilities as the points get farther from the centerline stretching from one goal post to the other
 * - Zero probability in the areas covered by opponent robots

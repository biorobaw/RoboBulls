 * AttackDriver Behavior

 * or just kick the ball towards the goal. It interacts with the blockers
 * such that if the robot with this behavior needs to kick, isAboutToKick() returns
 * true, and AttackStrategy ensures each blocker moves away using moveAwayFromDriver()

 * moves to an open spot.

 * their radius from the robot. Of course, this doesn't mean the ball won't hit

 * AttackDefend Behavior
 * Although a paradoxical name, this behavior is meant to provide defence on our side
 * of the field while the other robots are attacking. The purpose is such that when
 * we are attacking, we still want a defence when the enemy team steals the ball
 * and brings it over.
 * So, what this behavior does is set up a number of robots to gather in a formation
 * around the goal, and sit in the direction of the ball.

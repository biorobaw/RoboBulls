 * Strategy is the abstract base class for other strategy classes.
 * @ingroup Base Classes
 * All the strategy classes inherit from the Strategy class
 * and override and assignBeh() (assign behavior) function
 * that assigns behaviors to robots. In addition, derived classes
 * should/can override update() which updates the strategy after
 * behaviors have been assigned. An example use of the update
 * function is to keep track of information regarding the robots
 * assigned behaviors in assignBeh, but not actually assign anybody a
 * behavior unless a new condition is met. This allows for more dynamic
 * and complex strategies.
 *
 * <b>Creating a Strategy</b><br>
 * Similar to a behavior, users should include “strategy/strategy.h”
 * and override from the base class.
 * There are two functions that define a strategy--­­​assignBeh ​and ​update​.
 * Having at least ​assignBeh ​defined is required for a strategy. ​
 * assignBeh ​is a function that should use the ​GameModel ​and other
 * tools to figure out ​how ​to assign behaviors to robots. Next, to
 * use this strategy, it must be placed somewhere as a choosable option
 * in StrategyController.cpp ​. in ​StrategyController’s ​gameModelUpdated()
 * function,  users will see a “testing macro macro”­­ this is used by us
 * to ignore the RefBox’s commands to test only one strategy. Here, you
 * can add your own strategy in. */

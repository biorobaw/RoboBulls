 *
 * Movement::Move contains routines for controlling robot movement,
 * including pathfinding, three/four wheel omni movement, and the differential
 * control modules "closed loop control (CLC)."
 *
 * This is the Movement's core base class, it has some standardized features.
 * - Velocity multiplier via setVelocityMultiplier
 *   1.0 is normal velocity, 0.0 is no velocity. This is different from before.
 * - Obstacle avoidance or standard movement via withObstacleAvoid bool;
 *   However, this is abstracted from the velocity calculators; it only
 *   asks the calculators to compute velocity to the next points.

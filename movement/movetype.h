 * The purpose of this enum is for movement <i>modifiers</i>; for instance,
 * differential robots have sharp turns, no slowdown, and others; the omni
 * robots have max velocity and speed versions of their default movement 
 * calculators. In the case that the modifier is not supported by the
 * robot type go_to_pose has been passed, the default movement calculation
 * is used.

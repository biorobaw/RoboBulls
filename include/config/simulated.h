 * using the grSim simulator or the real-world vision cameras.
 * Since both are mostly the same, most changes take place in the
 * /communication module, but you can also use this constant to better-define
 * tolerances such as distance tolerances.
 * - define 0 = Not simulated; real world
 * - define 1 = Simulated; grSim */

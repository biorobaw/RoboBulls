 * Controls selection of an active strategy (play) based on the game state

 * The StrategyController can be seen as the main driver of the
 * robobulls2 project. It does a switch statement over the current
 * gamestate from the RefBox, and chooses a current active strategy.
 * It also defines frameBegin() and frameEnd() functions, which are
 * called at the start and end of each frame, respectively. Viewers
 * can see that the frameEnd function calls the perform function of
 * each robotâ€™s current Behavior, and is the routine that actually
 * uses the RobComm to sent the velocities to the robots for a frame. */

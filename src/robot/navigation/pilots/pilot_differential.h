     * @details Frequently used constant sets for closed loop control motion can be defined here.
     * Refer to the motion control folder on Robobulls Google Drive for papers on what
     * exactly the constants do. The diagram below shows how modifying the constants can
     * change the robotsâ€™ paths. The constants actually used focus on reducing the
     * distance/rho error more than the orientation error because straighter paths make
     * obstacle avoidance calculations easier. */

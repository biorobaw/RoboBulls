This is a branch from the Robobulls repository that implements(work in progress) 
neural networks for determining shooting probabilities and DDPG for reinforcement learning
for low level move-to-ball, shooting, and intercepting behaviors.

You will need Tensorflow and LibTorch(PyTorch C++) to run this project and update
their paths in the .pro file.
